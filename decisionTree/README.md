# Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Model

> DecisionTree 

Basic decision tree implementation, using `Numpy` and `Pandas`. It works both for regression and classification.

> Node

Binary tree implementation which is used as data structure for the deciosion tree


## Use cases


> decisionTreeClassification.py

Predict breast cancer being *benign* or *malignant*, from UCi breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset. Basic usage:

```bash
$ python decisionTreeClassification.py
```


> decisionTreeClassificationExtLib.py

Similar to the previous one, predicts breast cancer being *benign* or *malignant*. But this one is implemented using `Sklearn` implementation. Usage:

```bash
$ python decisionTreeClassificationExtLib.py
```

# Decision Trees and Random Forests




> decisionTree.py

Basic decision tree implementation, using `Numpy` and `Pandas`. It works both for regression and classification. Basic usage:

```bash
$ python logisticRegression.py
```
Predicts breast cancer being *benign* or *malignant*. 
 


> decisionTreeExtLib.py

Similar to the previous one, predicts breast cancer being *benign* or *malignant*. But this one is implemented using `Sklearn` . Usage:

```bash
$ python logisticRegressionExtLib.py
```

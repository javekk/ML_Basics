# Logistic Regression




> logisticRegression.py

Predict breast cancer being *benign* or *malignant*, based on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29). Implemented using `Numpy` only. Usage:

```bash
$ python logisticRegression.py ../data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv
```



> logisticRegressionExtLib.py

Similar to the previous implementation, but using the [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) library. Usage:

```bash
$ python logisticRegressionExtLib.py ../data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv
```
